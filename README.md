# Battle-Royale-Simulation-Using-Heatmaps
My focus with this project was to showcase a more advanced way to utilize heatmaps than simply for data analysis, which is their most common use case. The project consists of a simulator running in a 2D game world representing the top down map view of a Battle Royale game. The simulator emulates full rounds of a generic Battle Royale game, using custom built algorithms to sample data from an array of heatmaps to control where the safe zone shrinks toward and where to spawn new game objects. The heatmaps are heated up by a procedurally generated weather system, game object spawn locations and the AI pawns' actions during the simulation.
